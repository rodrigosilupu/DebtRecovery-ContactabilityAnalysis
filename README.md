# DebtRecovery-ContactabilityAnalysis

This repository houses the analysis and derived strategies from reviewing recent campaigns of a leading telemarketing and phone management company. Given the critical importance of contactability (the ratio determining how many leads turn into effective conversations with the line holder), we have pinpointed patterns and trends that influenced a recent 4% drop in the contactability ratio. Through a detailed examination of the data in ContactoCobranza.csv, this analysis aims to provide insights and strategic recommendations to enhance contactability, optimize debt collection campaigns, and ultimately recover a larger owed amount. The proposed solution seeks not only to improve the contactability KPI but also to reduce costs associated with unsuccessful outbound calls.
